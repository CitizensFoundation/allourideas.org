Hi,

= "Someone has uploaded the idea #{@choice} to your question '#{@question.the_name}' (#{HOST}#{@question.earl})"

Based on your settings, we have auto-activated the idea so that it may be seen and voted upon immediate.  If for whatever reason you need to de-activate this idea, go to the following url:
